## Elixir

I had the pleasure to participate in a writing project called  «Cache-Cachées» with [fable-Lab](https://www.fable-lab.com/association/), a non-profit organization.

Through digital tools, fab-Lab uses words and language to find new ways of expression for young and adults.

I wrote a story that included a «travelling word» i.e. a foreigner word that has entered the French language.  I have chosen «Elixir».

This project is also an invitation to discover unexpectedly four cities in the Paris region.

Each city had its original novel, divided into four parts and placed in a wooden box (a cache). There were also inside stickers, a map and a free expression booklet.

My story takes place in Paris, and the lector follows an old lady's journey, called Marguerite. While she was sleeping, she received in a dream a visit from a strange little boy. He gave her a mysterious tiny object before disappearing.

In this short novel, I am referring to alchemy vocabulary, [Jabir Ibn Hayyan Al Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan), [Charlemagne stained glass windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass_windows_of_Chartres_Cathedral#/media/File:Chartres_-_Vie_de_Charlemagne.JPG) and a legendary creature famous in many cultures as in Aztec and Chinese mythology.

I will not tell you more. Here you can find [the story in French](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QlKa9RVF9mTk5UkpjrwNF2Q6wbojRV3_/view?usp=sharing).
