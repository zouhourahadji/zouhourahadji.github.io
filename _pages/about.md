## My background


Hello, I’m Zouhoura (pronounce Zu-ra).

During the last eight years, I had the opportunity to work in several structures in France as a digital project manager. I was in charge of organizing, planning, and coordinating events, training, applications or services for customers.

Now, I live in Canada. During my office hours, I work as a communication and marketing officer. I write, create data visualization and work on UX design projects during my spare time.

This personal website is a way to show my skills and share ideas about my favourite topics.

You can find [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zouhourahadji/) and my resume (FR/EN).


Thank you!
