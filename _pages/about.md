## My background


Hello, I’m Zouhoura (pronounce Zu-ra)

During the last 8 years, I had the opportunity to work in several structures in France as a digital project manager. I was in charge of organizing, planning, coordinating events, training, applications or services for customers.

Now, I live in Canada. During my office hours, I work as a communication and marketing officer.
During my spare time, I write, create data vizualisations and work on UX design projects.

This personal website is a way to show my skills and share ideas about my favorite topics.

You can find [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zouhourahadji/) and my resume (FR/EN).


Thank you!
